K-Means Clustering Implementation: Financial Behavior Dataset
This Python script implements the K-Means Clustering algorithm on a financial behavior dataset consisting of 2,512 transaction samples. The goal of this project is to explore anomaly detection and uncover meaningful patterns in users‚Äô financial activities. This unsupervised learning task is conducted as part of a final submission for the Basic Machine Learning Program (BMLP).

The dataset includes various attributes that represent transactional behavior, which are used to group users into clusters with similar financial patterns. This clustering may help in identifying outliers or suspicious activities, often associated with fraud detection.

üîç Features of the Script:
Data Preprocessing: Missing value handling, normalization, and data cleaning.
K-Means Clustering: Iterative computation to assign clusters based on Euclidean distance.
Cluster Evaluation: Using methods like the Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters.
Result Visualization: (if included) Cluster distribution or PCA-reduced plots to show separation between clusters.

This project demonstrates the application of unsupervised learning for financial analytics, useful for both business decision support and machine learning practice.
